    "As we can see, in the dataset named *songs_df* we can find several attributes that we list in the next lines. I found the description of some of them in this [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/is-my-spotify-music-boring-an-analysis-involving-music-data-and-machine-learning-47550ae931de) and this [link](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Song name**: This is the song name, it serves as the index of the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Song popularity**: A number indicating how popular a song is. The higer the number the most popular the song is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Song duration ms***: A number with the duration of the song in miliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Acousticness**: This value describes how acoustic a song is. A score of 1.0 means the song is most likely to be an acoustic one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Danceability**: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Energy**: Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instrumentalness**: This value represents the amount of vocals in the song. The closer it is to 1.0, the more instrumental the song is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key**: The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Liveness**: This value describes the probability that the song was recorded with a live audience. According to the official documentation “a value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loudness**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audio mode**: Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spechiness**: “Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track”. If the speechiness of a song is above 0.66, it is probably made of spoken words, a score between 0.33 and 0.66 is a song that may contain both music and words, and a score below 0.33 means the song does not have any speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tempo**: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time signature**: An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audio valence**: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)."

The most interesting thing for me in this case is that we have data for **18835** songs and all the data is complete! We don't have any missing value for any of the features, which is really nice but usually this doesn't happens. In case we find missing value we need to decide what to do with them. We have several options depending on how many missing values we can find. The different options are: \n",

We could use for example the mean value for the entire column or we could use some more complicated methods like try to predict these values.
