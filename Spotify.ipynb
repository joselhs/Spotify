    "As we can see, in the dataset named *songs_df* we can find several attributes that we list in the next lines. I found the description of some of them in this [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/is-my-spotify-music-boring-an-analysis-involving-music-data-and-machine-learning-47550ae931de) and this [link](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Song name**: This is the song name, it serves as the index of the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Song popularity**: A number indicating how popular a song is. The higer the number the most popular the song is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Song duration ms***: A number with the duration of the song in miliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Acousticness**: This value describes how acoustic a song is. A score of 1.0 means the song is most likely to be an acoustic one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Danceability**: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Energy**: Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instrumentalness**: This value represents the amount of vocals in the song. The closer it is to 1.0, the more instrumental the song is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key**: The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Liveness**: This value describes the probability that the song was recorded with a live audience. According to the official documentation “a value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loudness**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audio mode**: Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spechiness**: “Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track”. If the speechiness of a song is above 0.66, it is probably made of spoken words, a score between 0.33 and 0.66 is a song that may contain both music and words, and a score below 0.33 means the song does not have any speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tempo**: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time signature**: An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audio valence**: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)."
